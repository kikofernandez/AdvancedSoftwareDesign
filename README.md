# Advanced Software Design

This repo contains the material for the course
Advanced Software Design (5 cr.) imparted at Uppsala University.

## CONTENT

Principles and methods for software design with a special focus on
object-oriented analysis and design, including topics such as domain modelling,
software architecture, class and object modelling, behavioural modelling, design
patterns, General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles (GRASP) design
principles, design evaluation and improvement, and refactoring. Practice by
designing a larger program.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

On completion of the course, the student should be able to:

- summarise and explain relevant design principles.

- use object-oriented programming methodology to design and implement larger
  programs.

- use a modelling language as a means to communicate realistic problems and their
  solutions.
- demonstrate understanding of the connection between modelling languages and
  programming languages, for example by implementing design models.

- use design patterns and other known solutions to design problems.

- evaluate the suitability of different design alternatives based on object
  oriented design principles, and identify design flaws in programs.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

- `README`, this document

- `Instructions`, contains the [1-Goals.pdf](Instructions/1-Goals.pdf) (exercises
  that students need to do) which must be applied to the project described in
  [2-Project.pdf](Instructions/2-Project.pdf)

- `slides`, contains lecture folders and each lecture may contain additional
  material. The slides usually contain examples and code.
